# A brief talk about Babel

## What is Babel?


`Babel` is a `JavaScript compiler` or a `compilation converter` from **source code to target code**.

- As you can see from this picture, `Babel` is divided into three stages, namely `parse` (parsing), `transform` (conversion) and `generate` (generation).

- First, start from the `source code` on the far left, which is the code we write daily, which will be analyzed by `parse`. This `parse` process will perform some analysis such as `lexical analysis` and `grammatical analysis` on our code. The operation finally generates an abstract syntax tree called `AST`.
 
- Then come to `transform`, where the parsed content is processed according to the rules we specified and converted into a new `AST` abstract syntax tree.

- Then come to `generate` and use our converted `AST` abstract syntax tree to generate new code, which is the target code.

These are the approximate execution flow of `Babel`.
